<p>My name is Sheriff Ahmed. I am 24 years old; I was born and raised in Staten Island, NY up until the beginning of my highschool years; I finished highschool and attended college in Florida. I learned a good amount of my computer knowledge from my brother, who currently works for Uber; he also introduced me to making music through a computer. When I began college, I started to tinker with FL Studio and scavenge the internet for knowledge on the program, eventually sought out to learn how music works and how to manipulate sound. As I searched for role models to gain inspiration in music, I learned about how coding was a gateway to computer-based music. Soon enough, I was interested in learning code to better communicate with my computer  in order to make the more mundane tasks of the music process much simpler and faster to complete.  </p>
